Section 1
I am making changes on my outline file inside the udemyrepopractice folder via VS code. 
Then I will add these changes to staging before I commit. 
Let's see whether it works actually. 

I am pretending to write a novel about time travel.

How can we travel in time or experience the simulation of it. 
No matter what we do, we will be only creating an alternative reality rather than manipulating
the existing timeline as something that is done cannot be undone and
one cannot bath in the same river twice.
